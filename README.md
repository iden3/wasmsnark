# wasmsnark

A fast zkSnark proof and verifier and proof generator written in native Web Assembly.

wasmsnark is used to generate zkSnark Proofs and verify the from the browser.

This module generates highly optimized Web Assembly modules for the low level
cryptographic primitives.

It also makes use of the Web Workers feature to parallelize the generation and verification
of the zero knoledge proofs.

The result is a fast library with times close to libsnarks but fully compatible for
browsers.

## Usage


### BN128
You just need to import the wasmsnark_bn128.js found in the build directory.

```html
<script src="wasmsnark_bn128.js" />
```

This library has a single javascript function:

genZKSnarkProof(witness, provingKey, cb)

cb is the callback.  If cb is undefined, then the function will return a promise.

witness is a binary buffer with all the signals in binnary format.  The buffer is packt in 32bytes Little Endian Encoded Field Elements.

You can use the tool to build the binary file from the witness.json file generated by [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs).

### IMPORTANT: Please be sure you run your setup with `--protocol groth`  wasmsnark only generates groth16 proofs!

```
node ../tools/buildwitness.js -i witness.json -o witness.bin
```

provingKey is the binary buffer with the binary representation of the proving key.

Check the tool tools/buildpkey.js to convert a proving_key.json file generated
in [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) to a proving_key.bin file that can
be used directly with this library.

```
node ../tools/buildpkey.js -i proving_key.json -o proving_key.bin
```

The result is a JSON object with pi_a, pi_b and pi_c points.

You can use the stringified version of this JSON as a proof.json in [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)


Here is a simple example of a web page that loads a key and a witness and generates the proof when the button is pressed.

```html
<html>
<header>
</header>
<script src="wasmsnark_bn128.js"></script>
<script>

var witness;
var provingKey;

function onLoad() {

    fetch("proving_key.bin").then( (response) => {
        return response.arrayBuffer();
    }).then( (b) => {
        provingKey = b;
    });

    fetch("witness.bin").then( (response) => {
        return response.arrayBuffer();
    }).then( (b) => {
        witness = b;
    });
}

function calcProof() {
    const start = new Date().getTime();
    document.getElementById("time").innerHTML = "processing....";
    document.getElementById("proof").innerHTML = "";

    window.genZKSnarkProof(witness, provingKey).then((p)=> {
        const end = new Date().getTime();
        const time = end - start;
        document.getElementById("time").innerHTML = `Time to compute: ${time}ms`;
        document.getElementById("proof").innerHTML = JSON.stringify(p, null, 1);
    });
}

</script>
<body onLoad="onLoad()">
<h1>iden3</h1>
<h2>Zero knowledge proof generator</h2>
<button onClick="calcProof()">Test</button>
<div id="time"></div>
<pre id="proof"></pre>

</body>
</html>
```

You can test it by running a web server on the example directory

```
npm -g install http-server
cd example/bn128
http-server .
```

And then navegate to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

The generated proof can be cut and pasted to `example/bn128/proof.json` and tested with snarkjs

```
snarkjs verify
```

### MNT6753

The directory `example/mnt6753` contains an example of the verifier.

## Building wasm.js

```
npm run build
```

## Testing

```
npm test
```
